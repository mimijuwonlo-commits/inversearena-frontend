# Soroban contract deployment guide

Step-by-step instructions to **build**, **deploy**, and **wire** the Inverse Arena Soroban workspace (`factory`, `arena`, `payout`, `staking`) on **Stellar testnet** and **mainnet**.

> **Note:** Contract logic in this repo may still be minimal (stubs). As constructors and admin entrypoints are added, extend the **Initialization** section with real `contract invoke` examples and keep this file updated.

---

## Prerequisites

| Requirement | Purpose |
|---------------|---------|
| **Rust** | Recent **stable** toolchain (Soroban SDK 22 targets modern Rust; this workspace uses **edition 2024** — use a current `rustup` stable that supports it, or follow `rustc` errors to upgrade). |
| **Wasm target** | `rustup target add wasm32-unknown-unknown` (CLI may add `wasm32v1-none` automatically — use what `stellar contract build` expects). |
| **Stellar CLI** (`stellar`) | Build, deploy, and invoke contracts. [Install Stellar CLI](https://developers.stellar.org/docs/tools/cli/stellar-cli) (`stellar --version` to verify). |
| **jq** (optional) | Parsing JSON in shell examples. |
| **A funded Stellar account** | Deployer identity on the target network (testnet faucet below; mainnet funded from exchange or custodian). |

Confirm CLI:

```bash
stellar --version
rustc --version
```

---

## Repository layout

Workspace members (each produces its own WASM):

| Crate | Package name | Typical WASM artifact |
|-------|----------------|-------------------------|
| `contract/factory` | `factory` | `factory.wasm` |
| `contract/arena` | `arena` | `arena.wasm` |
| `contract/payout` | `payout` | `payout.wasm` |
| `contract/staking` | `staking` | `staking.wasm` |

Build output paths are printed by the CLI; they are usually under `target/` with a `wasm32*` release directory.

---

## 1. Build

From the **workspace root** `contract/`:

```bash
cd contract
```

### Option A — Stellar CLI (recommended)

```bash
stellar contract build
```

This builds all workspace contracts. To build one package:

```bash
stellar contract build --package factory
```

### Option B — Cargo only

```bash
cargo build --target wasm32-unknown-unknown --release -p factory
```

Repeat with `-p arena`, `-p payout`, `-p staking` as needed.

Locate the `.wasm` files (CLI output shows paths). Common patterns:

- `target/wasm32-unknown-unknown/release/*.wasm`
- or `target/wasm32v1-none/release/*.wasm` (depending on toolchain / CLI version)

---

## 2. Network identities & funding

### Create a deployer key (once per machine)

```bash
stellar keys generate deployer
stellar keys address deployer
```

### Testnet — fund the account

Use any of:

- **Stellar Laboratory** — [Create account / Friendbot](https://lab.stellar.org/) (select **Testnet**), paste your public key, request XLM.
- **Horizon Friendbot** (example; check [current testnet docs](https://developers.stellar.org/docs/build/guides/friendbot) for the exact URL):

```bash
curl "https://friendbot.stellar.org/?addr=<YOUR_PUBLIC_G_ADDRESS>"
```

You need enough XLM to pay transaction fees and Soroban rent/deposit for deploy + invoke.

### Mainnet — fund the account

Use your organization’s process (exchange withdrawal, custody, treasury). **Never commit secret keys.** Use hardware wallets or multisig for production deployers.

---

## 3. Deploy (testnet)

Set the network to **testnet** (CLI profiles vary by version; use one of the patterns below).

**Passphrase (testnet):**

```text
Test SDF Network ; September 2015
```

**Public RPC / Horizon (testnet defaults):**

| Service | URL |
|---------|-----|
| Soroban RPC | `https://soroban-testnet.stellar.org` |
| Horizon | `https://horizon-testnet.stellar.org` |

Deploy a single WASM (replace WASM path with the file from your build):

```bash
stellar contract deploy \
  --wasm target/wasm32-unknown-unknown/release/factory.wasm \
  --source deployer \
  --network testnet
```

The command prints the **contract ID** (starts with `C` on Soroban). Save it.

Repeat for `arena`, `payout`, and `staking` with the correct WASM paths.

> If your CLI uses **upload + deploy** in two steps, follow [Stellar’s upload & deploy cookbook](https://developers.stellar.org/docs/tools/cli/cookbook/upload-deploy): upload WASM, then deploy the contract instance from the uploaded hash.

---

## 4. Initialization (invoke)

After deployment, call any **constructor** or **admin init** functions your contracts expose. The current stubs may only expose a trivial `hello`; when real init methods exist, examples will look like:

```bash
stellar contract invoke \
  --id <CONTRACT_ID> \
  --source deployer \
  --network testnet \
  -- \
  init \
  --admin <G_ADDRESS>
```

Replace `init`, argument names, and types with your contract’s actual interface. Use `stellar contract inspect --wasm <file.wasm>` or published ABI to list callable functions.

**Deployment order (typical for a factory pattern):**

1. Deploy **factory** (and any shared libraries if split).
2. Deploy **arena** / **payout** / **staking** as designed (some may be created by the factory — follow product spec).
3. Run init calls per contract.
4. Register addresses in the frontend env (next section).

### Factory-created arenas

`factory.create_pool(...)` now performs the arena bootstrap needed for a usable pool in one transaction:

1. deploy the arena contract
2. call `init(round_speed)`
3. call `initialize(factory_address)`
4. call `set_token(currency)`
5. transfer arena admin to the caller with `set_admin(caller)`

That means a newly created arena is immediately joinable; no manual post-creation `set_token()` call is required anymore.

---

## 5. Deploy (mainnet)

**Passphrase (mainnet):**

```text
Public Global Stellar Network ; September 2015
```

**Public endpoints (examples — verify current docs):**

| Service | URL |
|---------|-----|
| Soroban RPC | `https://soroban-mainnet.stellar.org` |
| Horizon | `https://horizon.stellar.org` |

Use a **dedicated mainnet deployer** with minimal balance, multisig where possible, and audited WASM.

```bash
stellar contract deploy \
  --wasm target/wasm32-unknown-unknown/release/factory.wasm \
  --source mainnet-deployer \
  --network mainnet
```

### Mainnet upgrade / migration (high level)

When you ship a new WASM:

1. **Build** and **test** on testnet first.
2. **Upload** the new WASM (or use the CLI’s upgrade flow if your contract implements [SAC / upgradeable](https://developers.stellar.org/docs/build/smart-contracts) patterns).
3. **Invoke** the contract’s upgrade path (e.g. `upgrade` or `migrate`) if applicable — *only if your Rust code implements this*.
4. **Verify** on Horizon / Soroban RPC (read-only simulations).
5. **Update** frontend and backend env vars; coordinate release windows.

Exact upgrade commands depend on your contract ABI; document them here when implemented.

---

## 6. Environment variables (frontend)

The Next.js app reads public env vars (see `frontend/src/components/hook-d/arenaConstants.ts`). Set these in `.env.local` (never commit secrets):

### Testnet example

```env
NEXT_PUBLIC_STELLAR_NETWORK_PASSPHRASE=Test SDF Network ; September 2015
NEXT_PUBLIC_SOROBAN_RPC_URL=https://soroban-testnet.stellar.org
NEXT_PUBLIC_HORIZON_URL=https://horizon-testnet.stellar.org

NEXT_PUBLIC_FACTORY_CONTRACT_ID=C...
NEXT_PUBLIC_STAKING_CONTRACT_ID=C...
NEXT_PUBLIC_USDC_CONTRACT_ID=C...
```

Optional overrides if defaults change:

- `NEXT_PUBLIC_STAKING_CONTRACT_ID` — staking contract (required for stake flows when not placeholder).

### Mainnet example

```env
NEXT_PUBLIC_STELLAR_NETWORK_PASSPHRASE=Public Global Stellar Network ; September 2015
NEXT_PUBLIC_SOROBAN_RPC_URL=https://soroban-mainnet.stellar.org
NEXT_PUBLIC_HORIZON_URL=https://horizon.stellar.org

NEXT_PUBLIC_FACTORY_CONTRACT_ID=C...
NEXT_PUBLIC_STAKING_CONTRACT_ID=C...
NEXT_PUBLIC_USDC_CONTRACT_ID=C...
```

**XLM SAC** on testnet is often fixed in code (`CAS3J7GYLGXMF6TDJBXBGMELNUPVCGXIZ68TZE6GTVASJ63Y32KXVY77` in `arenaConstants.ts`); confirm mainnet USDC/XLM asset contract IDs from [Stellar asset docs](https://developers.stellar.org/docs/build/guides/tokens) before production.

---

## 7. Quick reference — workspace packages

```bash
cd contract
stellar contract build --package factory
stellar contract build --package arena
stellar contract build --package payout
stellar contract build --package staking
```

---

## 8. Troubleshooting

| Issue | What to check |
|--------|----------------|
| `wasm32` target missing | `rustup target list --installed` and add the target the CLI requests. |
| CLI not found | Install Stellar CLI; ensure it is on `PATH`. |
| Insufficient balance | Fund deployer on testnet via Friendbot; mainnet via treasury. |
| Wrong network | Passphrase and RPC URLs must match (testnet vs mainnet). |
| `edition 2024` / Rust version errors | Upgrade Rust stable or align with Soroban SDK release notes. |

- [Soroban Rust SDK](https://docs.rs/soroban-sdk)
- Error code registry for this repo: `contract/ERRORS.md`

---

## 10. Acceptance checklist (for operators)

- [ ] Rust + Stellar CLI installed and `stellar contract build` succeeds in `contract/`.
- [ ] Testnet deployer funded; all required WASM deployed; contract IDs recorded.
- [ ] Initialization invocations completed (when contract exposes them).
- [ ] `.env.local` updated with IDs and correct network URLs/passphrase.
- [ ] Mainnet: separate process, audited WASM, multisig / key policy followed.
