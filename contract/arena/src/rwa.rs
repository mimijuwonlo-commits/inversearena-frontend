/// RWA yield vault adapter for the ArenaContract.
///
/// Provides a thin layer over cross-contract vault calls so the rest of the
/// arena logic stays decoupled from the specific vault interface.
///
/// # Fallback behaviour
///
/// All vault interaction in the arena is gated on the `VAULT_ACTIVE_KEY` flag.
/// When the primary vault is unavailable, the admin calls
/// `toggle_vault_active(false)` before game completion. This emits a
/// `VaultFallbackActivated` event and causes `complete_with_yield` to fall
/// back to awarding the on-hand principal with zero yield, ensuring no winner
/// payout is ever blocked by an external dependency.
///
/// In Soroban, cross-contract `invoke_contract` calls panic (reverting the
/// transaction) if the callee panics — there is no in-transaction catch.
/// The admin-toggled fallback is therefore the primary mechanism for graceful
/// degradation. A secondary fallback vault address can be configured via
/// `set_fallback_vault` for future use when the SDK supports try-invocations.
///
/// # Vault interface
///
/// The primary (and fallback) vault is expected to expose:
/// - `deposit(token: Address, amount: i128) -> i128`  — returns shares minted.
/// - `withdraw(shares: i128) -> i128`                 — burns shares, returns tokens.
